#### Created a REST API to handle the **form submission** and the **search submission**
###### - Information is saved to a `db` (form submission)
###### - The db is originally seeded with at least 50 model objects
###### - After each form submission the `db` is populated
###### - Create various routes, following REST. I can `create`, `findAll`, apply filters, ..etc.
